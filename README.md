# dor-scripts

### The Devel/ Folder

Note: This folder was moved from `sul-dlss/pre-assmebly`. Devel/ contained a collection of one off scripts. It was convenient to do this for the infrastructure team, because we are clearning `sul-dlss/pre-assembly` to turn it into a web application. 
The scripts will need some additional configuration. For example, the `devel/` folder require's the `boot.rb` and the configuration that comes with that. Also require's the dor mounts.
